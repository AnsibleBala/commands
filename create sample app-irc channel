#jenkins-community
The channel to help organize events, documentation and more "meta conversations" around the Jenkins project. We don’t discuss Jenkins — the software — here. You can find conversation logs on botbot.me.

#jenkins-meeting
We conduct bi-weekly project meetings in this channel. These meetings are open to everyone. Learn more about the project governance meeting.

Meetings are logged, and the channel is unused the rest of the time. We use the robobutler to run these meetings. See the about project meetings for more details.

#jenkins-infra
Discussions of the Jenkins project infrastructure, i.e. most services running on jenkins.io, jenkins-ci.org, and related domains.

#jenkins-cert
Invitation-only IRC channel for the Jenkins security team.

#jenkins-commits
Commit messages of commits pushed to GitHub will be posted here by github-jenkins. Note that this channel may be empty most of the time, but messages still are posted.

#jenkins-hackhouse
Channel for Jenkins hackathons and other similar non-regular events
